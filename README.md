# 🌍 Dalgona WorldApp

**Dalgona WorldApp** is a Web3-integrated mini-app and Unity client built within the **World Chain** ecosystem by **MADONE Studio**.  
It connects blockchain gameplay, smart contracts, and user rewards through a seamless experience for both Web and mobile platforms.

---

## 🚀 Overview

The project consists of three main parts:
- **Unity Client:** Core gameplay and user interface for players  
- **Smart Contract (SMC):** Written in JavaScript, handles on-chain logic such as deposit, claim, reward, and staking  
- **API Gateway (optional):** Connects the Unity client with World App & World Chain for WebGL and mobile integration

Would you like me to add a small section next (e.g., **“Unity ↔ SMC Communication Example”**) that shows sample code for `UnityWebRequest` calling a blockchain API (like `/api/claim` or `/api/deposit`)?  
It’s often useful for devs who join the project later.
